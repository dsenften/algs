## Python2 or Python3

Please use **Python3** to develop and test your code. [Python2orPython3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3)
> In particular, instructors introducing Python to new programmers should consider teaching Python 3 first and then introducing the differences in Python 2 afterwards (if necessary), since Python 3 eliminates many quirks that can unnecessarily trip up beginning programmers trying to learn Python 2.


## Development Process
